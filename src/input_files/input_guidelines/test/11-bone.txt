1.11 Sarcomas
Separate recommendations have been made for adults and for children and young people to reflect that there are different referral pathways. In practice young people (aged 16 to 24) may be referred using either pathway depending on their age and local arrangements.

Bone sarcoma in adults
1.11.1 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for adults if an X-ray suggests the possibility of bone sarcoma. [2015]

Bone sarcoma in children and young people
1.11.2 Consider a very urgent referral (for an appointment within 48 hours) for specialist assessment for children and young people if an X-ray suggests the possibility of bone sarcoma. [2015]
1.11.3 Consider a very urgent direct access X-ray (to be done within 48 hours) to assess for bone sarcoma in children and young people with unexplained bone swelling or pain. [2015]

Soft tissue sarcoma in adults
1.11.4 Consider an urgent, direct access ultrasound scan (to be done within 2 weeks) to assess for soft tissue sarcoma in adults with an unexplained lump that is increasing in size. [2015] 
1.11.5 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for adults if they have ultrasound scan findings that are suggestive of soft tissue sarcoma or if ultrasound findings are uncertain and clinical concern persists. [2015]

Soft tissue sarcoma in children and young people
1.11.6 Consider a very urgent, direct access ultrasound scan (to be done within 48 hours) to assess for soft tissue sarcoma in children and young people with an unexplained lump that is increasing in size. [2015]
1.11.7 Consider a very urgent referral (for an appointment within 48 hours) for children and young people if they have ultrasound scan findings that are suggestive of soft tissue sarcoma or if ultrasound findings are uncertain and clinical concern persists. [2015]

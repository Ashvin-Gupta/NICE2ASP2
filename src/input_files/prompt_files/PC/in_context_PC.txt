You are an expert in Answer Set Programming (ASP) logic and clinical guideline formalization.

Task Plan
1. Carefully read the clinical guideline text in the Problem text.
2. Identify each logical condition, exception, and action in the text.
3. Express each as an ASP rule following the pattern used in the examples (Problems 1–6).
4. For negated recommendations (“Do not offer...”), produce constraints (:- ...).
5. Preserve temporal or conditional sequencing using offered(X) when a later action depends on a previous offer.
6. Output all resulting rules grouped by their guideline reference number, using the format:
    [rule_number]
    rule1.
    rule2.
    ...

Background knowledge:
1. offered(X) :- offer(X).
    This encodes temporal relationships between offered procedures or imaging steps.
    Make sure rules are not in the form offer(X) :- offered(X) as this implies that we can only offer X if has already been offered which is impossible. 
2. Age is represented as age(X), X>=number.
3. The notation 1{{A;B}}2 means choose at least 1 and at most 2 options from the set. Can use this in both the head (before :-) or in the body (after :-) and can help with simplification. 
4. The symbol :- at the start of the line denotes a constraint (e.g anything atoms in the body cannot be exist together).
5. Use the constants and predicates provided — do not invent new ones.
6. The rules must be ASP valid. One condition is that the rules must be grounded, meaning if a variable appears in the head, it must also appear in a postive, non-built-in predicate in the body. If it appears in quatation marks it is fine.
    e.g offer(P) :- body1, procedure(P) is correct. The procedure(P) is needed otherwise it is not grounded.
    offer("ct scan") :- have("pain") is also correct.

Reasoning Pattern
1. Identify who the rule applies to (conditions → body).
2. Identify what is being offered, referred, or done (action → head).
3. Identify exceptions or negations (not have(S) or :- ...).
4. Identify temporal links between rules (offered(X), findings(I, Gf)).

Examples:

Example 1:
People without jaundice who have pancreatic abnormalities on imaging: 
Offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan to people with pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice. If the diagnosis is still unclear offer FDG-PET/CT and/or EUS with EUS-guided tissue sampling.

ASP:
offer("pancreatic_protocol_ct") :- have("pancreatic_abnormalities"), not have("jaundice").
1 {{offer("FDG-PET/CT"); offer("EUS", "EUS-guided tissue sampling")}} 2 :- have("pancreatic_abnormalities"), not have("jaundice"), offered("pancreatic_protocol_ct"), findings("pancreatic_protocol_ct", "diagnosis_unclear").

Reasoning:
Main action: offer CT → offer("pancreatic_protocol_ct") from first statement. offer FDG-PET/CT or EUR with tissue → offer("FDG-PET/CT"), offer("EUS_with_tissue") from second statement.
Conditions: have abnormalities, not have jaundice from the first statement. findings of CT procedure means an unclear from the second statement.
Temporal rule: if CT was offered and diagnosis still unclear → offer further procedures. Symptoms from first conditions carry on over as statements are linked.

% These rules read as: 
% If the patient has pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice then offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan.
% If the findings from the pancreatic protocol CT are unclear then choose at least 1 but no more than 2 of the options in the curly brackets
% Note the offered(I) predicate is VERY important here as it allows us to have temporal relationships within our rules.

Example 2:
People with pancreatic cysts:
Consider fine-needle aspiration during EUS if more information on the likelihood of malignancy is needed.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Techniques: "fine-needle aspiration"
General_findings: "more information on the likelihood of malignancy".
Symptoms: "pancreatic cysts".

Predicates:
consider(P, T)
need(Gf)
have(S)

ASP:
consider("EUS", "fine-needle aspiration") :- need("more information on the likelihood of malignancy"), have("pancreatic cysts").

% This rule reads as: 
% If the patient has pancreatic cysts and we need more information on the liklihood of malignancy then consider EUS with fine-needle aspiration.

Example 3:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer to people with:
• hereditary pancreatitis and a PRSS1 mutation
• BRCA1 or BRCA2, and one or more firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer

ASP:
offer("surveillance", "pancreatic_cancer") :- have("inherited_high_risk"), have("hereditary_pancreatitis"), have("PRSS1").
offer("surveillance", "pancreatic_cancer") :- have("inherited_high_risk"), 1{{have("BRCA1"); have("BRCA2"); have("PALB2"); have("CDKN2A")}}4, first_degree_relative("pancreatic_cancer",_).

% These rules read as: 
% If the patient has inherited high risk, hereditary pancreatitis and PRSS1 then offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer.
% If the patient has inherited high risk, any first degree relaticve with pancreatic cancer and has any one of the genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, CDKN2A, then offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer.

% Note that we represent how many first degree relatives have a disease in the format first_degree_relative(D,X), where D is the disease and X is person X. 
% Both D and X can be left blank, _, if we do not know the disease or the person. If there are two people that have the same diesase we could exploit this syntax and write X!=Y to show that they are different people.

Example 4:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Do not offer EUS to detect pancreatic cancer in people with hereditary pancreatitis.

ASP:
:- have("inherited_high_risk"), offer("EUS"), have("hereditary_pancreatitis").

% This rule reads as: 
% Do not offer EUS if the patient has inherited high risk and hereditary pancreatitis

Example 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for pancreatic cancer if they are aged 40 and over and have jaundice.

ASP:
refer("suspected_cancer_pathway", "pancreatic_cancer") :- age(X), have("jaundice"), X>=40.

% These rules read as: 
% If the patient is above the age of 40 and has jaundice then refer to the suspected cancer pathway
% Note that we represent the age of the patient in the format age(X), where X is the age of the patient.

Example 6:
Consider an urgent, direct access CT scan (to be done within 2 weeks), or an urgent ultrasound scan if CT is not available, to assess for pancreatic cancer in people aged 60 and over with weight loss and any of the following:
•	diarrhoea
•   back pain
•   abdominal pain
•   nausea
•   vomiting
•   constipation
•   new-onset diabetes.

ASP:
consider("CT_scan") :- age(X), have("unexplained_weight_loss"), 1{{have("diarrhoea"); have("back_pain"); have("abdominal_pain"); have("nausea"); have("vomiting"); have("constipation"); have("new_onset_diabetes")}}7, X>60.
consider("ultrasound") :- age(X), have("unexplained_weight_loss"), 1{{have("diarrhoea"); have("back_pain"); have("abdominal_pain"); have("nausea"); have("vomiting"); have("constipation"); have("new_onset_diabetes")}}7, X>60, not available("CT_scan").

% These rules are read as
% If the patient is over the age of 60, has unexplained weight loss and any one of diarrhoea, back pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or new-onset diabetes then consider an urgent CT scan.
% If the same conditions are present but the CT scan is not available then consider and ultrasound instead.

1.3 Lower gastrointestinal tract cancers

Colorectal cancer 
1.3.1 Offer quantitative faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) using HM-JACKarc or OC-Sensor to guide referral for suspected colorectal cancer in adults: 
• with an abdominal mass or
• with a change in bowel habit or
• with iron-deficiency anaemia or
• aged 40 and over with unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain or
• aged under 50 with rectal bleeding and either of the following unexplained symptoms:
    － abdominal pain
    － weight loss or
• aged 50 and over with any of the following unexplained symptoms:
    － rectal bleeding
    － abdominal pain
    － weight loss or
• aged 60 and over with anaemia even in the absence of iron deficiency.
FIT should be offered even if the person has previously had a negative FIT result through the NHS bowel cancer screening programme. People with a rectal mass, an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration do not need to be offered FIT before referral is considered. [2023] 
1.3.2 Refer adults using a suspected cancer pathway referral for colorectal cancer if they have a FIT result of at least 10 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces. [2023]
1.3.3 For people who have not returned a faecal sample or who have a FIT result below 10 micrograms of haemoglobin per gram of faeces:
• safety netting processes should be in place
• referral to an appropriate secondary care pathway should not be delayed if there is strong clinical concern of cancer because of ongoing unexplained  symptoms (for example, abdominal mass). [2023]
1.3.4 Clinicians should consider if people need additional help, information or support to return their sample. [2023]
1.3.5 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for colorectal cancer in adults with a rectal mass. [2015, amended 2023] 

Anal cancer
1.3.6 Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral for anal cancer in people with an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration. [2015]

You are an expert in extracting and classifying medical constants from text.

Task plan:
1. Read the problem text carefully and identify all distinct medical concepts.
2. Classify each concept into one of the provided categories below.
3. Use the minimum exact wording from the text (do not paraphrase and no verbose phrases).
4. Output only the constants grouped by category in the specified format.

Category definitions:
1. Disease: Specific disease names (e.g., "pancreatic cancer").
2. Symptoms: Observable signs or symptoms (e.g., "jaundice", "weight loss").
3. Imaging: Diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g., "CT", "MRI").
4. Procedures: Medical interventions or diagnostic techniques (e.g., "EUS", "biopsy").
5. Finding_of_pancreas: Imaging or pathology findings specific to pancreas.
6. Genetic_disease: Inherited or genetic syndromes or mutations.
7. Management: Clinical management pathways or types of referral.
8. Treatments: Interventions for treating disease (e.g., "chemotherapy").
9. Anatomical_structures: Named body parts or regions.
10. Information_about_patient: Demographic or risk-related details (e.g., "40", "first-degree relatives").
11. General_findings: Concepts describing diagnostic uncertainty or test results (e.g., "unclear diagnosis", "more information").

Examples:

Example 1:
People without jaundice who have pancreatic abnormalities on imaging: 
Offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan to people with pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice. If the diagnosis is still unclear offer FDG-PET/CT and/or EUS with EUS-guided tissue sampling.

Constants:
Imaging: "pancreatic protocol CT".
Finding_of_pancreas: "pancreatic abnormalities".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Procedures: "FDG-PET/CT", "EUS", "EUS-guided tissue sampling".
General_findings: "unclear diagnosis".

(Reasoning: “jaundice” → Symptom; “pancreatic protocol CT” → Imaging; “FDG-PET/CT” → Procedure; “unclear diagnosis” → General finding)

Example 2:
People with pancreatic cysts:
Consider fine-needle aspiration during EUS if more information on the likelihood of malignancy is needed.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS", "fine-needle aspiration".
Understanding_of_diagnosis: "more information on the likelihood of malignancy".
Symptoms: "pancreatic cysts".

Example 3:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer to people with:
• hereditary pancreatitis and a PRSS1 mutation
• BRCA1 or BRCA2, and one or more firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Management: "surveillance".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis", "PRSS1", "BRCA1", "BRCA2".
Information_about_patient: "firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer", "inherited high risk".

Example 4:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Do not offer EUS to detect pancreatic cancer in people with hereditary pancreatitis.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis".
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Information_about_patient: "inherited high risk".

Example 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for pancreatic cancer if they are aged 40 and over and have jaundice.

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Management: "suspected cancer pathway referral".

Example 6:
Consider an urgent, direct access CT scan (to be done within 2 weeks), or an urgent ultrasound scan if CT is not available, to assess for pancreatic cancer in people aged 60 and over with weight loss and any of the following:
•	diarrhoea
•   back pain
•   abdominal pain
•   nausea
•   vomiting
•   constipation
•   new-onset diabetes.

Constants:
Symptoms: "weight loss", "diarrhoea", "back pain", "abdominal pain", "nausea", "vomiting", "constipation", "new-onset diabetes".
Imaging: "CT", "ultrasound".
Information_about_patient: "60".

Output Format:
Constants:
Category1: "constant1", "constant2".
Category2: "constant1", "constant2".

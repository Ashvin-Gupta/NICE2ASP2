Looking at this lung cancer diagnostic guideline text, I'll identify the predicates needed to capture all the relationships between the constants.

Based on the text analysis, here are the predicates:

```
offer(I)
offer(P)
offer(M)
consider(I)
consider(P)
have(S)
have(D)
have(Gf)
have(Ip)
findings(I, Gf)
refer(M, D)
use(P)
decline(P)
tolerate(P)
assess(As)
assess(D)
perform(I)
perform(P)
biopsy(As)
biopsy(Gf)
evaluate(As)
provide(Tr)
need(Tr)
suitable(Tr)
```

These predicates capture:
- Clinical actions (offer, consider, refer, use, perform)
- Patient conditions (have for symptoms/diseases/findings)
- Patient responses (decline, tolerate)
- Diagnostic assessments (assess, biopsy, evaluate)
- Treatment provisions (provide, need, suitable)
- Diagnostic findings (findings linking imaging to general findings)

The predicates follow the established patterns where offer/consider indicate recommended actions, have denotes patient features, and findings encodes diagnostic results. The variable naming convention is maintained throughout.

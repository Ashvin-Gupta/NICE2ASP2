You are an expert in clinical logic and Answer Set Programming (ASP).

Task plan:
Your goal is to generate all necessary predicates that express relationships among the extracted constants from a clinical guideline statements.

1. Read the problem text carefully.
2. Review the provided constants and their categories.
3. Identify all actions, relationships, or conditions that connect constants.
4. Convert these relationships into predicates of the form predicate(X1, X2, ..., Xn) where each argument corresponds to a category (e.g., Imaging, Symptoms, Procedures, etc.).
5. Use the minimum number of predicates needed to capture all relationships (avoid redundancy).
6. Use the patterns and examples provided to ensure consistency.


General Guidance
1. Predicates typically correspond to verbs or key relationships in the guideline text.
2. In clinical guidelines, offer usually denotes a recommended action; have denotes patient features; findings encodes diagnostic results or follow-up conditions.
3. Temporal relationships (e.g., "if diagnosis still unclear after CT") should use the predicate offered(X) to indicate a previously performed procedure.
4. There should never be the word 'not' included in the predicate
5. Somtimes certain constants will have adjectives such as new-onset or unexplained or suspected. In this case can increase the airity of the predicate to two and have the rule as for example have(<disease>, <adjective>).

Variable Naming Convention
Use the following variable conventions throughout:

D  – Disease
S  – Symptoms
I  – Imaging
P  – Procedures
Fl – Finding_of_lung
Gd – Genetic_disease
M  – Management
Tr – Treatments
As – Anatomical_structures
Ip – Information_about_patient
Gf – General_findings

Examples:

Example 1:
People without jaundice who have pancreatic abnormalities on imaging: 
Offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan to people with pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice. If the diagnosis is still unclear offer FDG-PET/CT and/or EUS with EUS-guided tissue sampling.

Constants:
Imaging: "pancreatic protocol CT".
Finding_of_pancreas: "pancreatic abnormalities".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Procedures: "FDG-PET/CT", "EUS", "EUS-guided tissue sampling".
General_findings: "unclear diagnosis".

Predicates:
offer(I)
offer(P)
offer(P, P)
have(Fp)
have(S)
findings(I, Gf)
offered(I)

% Note the offered(I) predicate is VERY important here as it allows us to have temporal relationships within our rules.
% Note the predicate findings(I, Gf). This predicate should be used in situations where we have a finding Gf from an imaging I where the finding could be information such as 'diagnosis unclear', 'localised disease', 'malignant' etc.
% Note we can have multiple predicates with the same name but different arity such as offer(P), offer(P, P), where a higher arity predicate is able to express more specific relations. 

Example 2:
People with pancreatic cysts:
Consider fine-needle aspiration during EUS if more information on the likelihood of malignancy is needed.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Techniques: "fine-needle aspiration"
General_findings: "more information on the likelihood of malignancy".
Symptoms: "pancreatic cysts".

Predicates:
consider(P, T)
need(Gf)
have(S)

Example 3:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer to people with:
• hereditary pancreatitis and a PRSS1 mutation
• BRCA1 or BRCA2, and one or more firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Management: "surveillance".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis", "PRSS1", "BRCA1", "BRCA2".
Information_about_patient: "firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer", "inherited high risk".

Predicates:
offer(M, D)
have(Gd)
have(Ip)
first_degree_relative(D, PersonID)

Example 4:
People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer: 
Do not offer EUS to detect pancreatic cancer in people with hereditary pancreatitis.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis".
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Information_about_patient: "inherited high risk".

Predicates:
offer(P)
have(Gd)
have(Ip)

Example 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for pancreatic cancer if they are aged 40 and over and have jaundice.

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Management: "suspected cancer pathway referral".

Predicates:
refer(M, D)
have(S)
have(Ip)

Example 6:
Consider an urgent, direct access CT scan (to be done within 2 weeks), or an urgent ultrasound scan if CT is not available, to assess for pancreatic cancer in people aged 60 and over with weight loss and any of the following:
•	diarrhoea
•   back pain
•   abdominal pain
•   nausea
•   vomiting
•   constipation
•   new-onset diabetes.

Constants:
Symptoms: "weight loss", "diarrhoea", "back pain", "abdominal pain", "nausea", "vomiting", "constipation", "new-onset diabetes".
Imaging: "CT", "ultrasound".
Information_about_patient: "60".

Predicates:
consider(I)
have(S)

Self-Verification Checklist
1. Before producing the final answer:
2. Each predicate must be grounded in a verb or explicit relationship from the text.
3. All variables must correspond to one of the defined constant categories.
4. Avoid redundant or semantically overlapping predicates.
5. Ensure predicates generalize correctly across multiple rules (avoid overspecification).
6. Output only the list of predicates — no extra commentary or explanation.

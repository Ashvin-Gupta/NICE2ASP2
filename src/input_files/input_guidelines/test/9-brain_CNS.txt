1.9 Brain and central nervous system cancers

Adults
1.9.1 Consider an urgent, direct access, MRI scan of the brain (or CT scan if MRI is contraindicated; to be done within 2 weeks) to assess for brain or central nervous system cancer in adults with progressive, sub-acute loss of central neurological
function. [2015]

Children and young people
1.9.2 Consider a very urgent referral (for an appointment within 48 hours) for suspected brain or central nervous system cancer in children and young people with newly abnormal cerebellar or other central neurological function. [2015]

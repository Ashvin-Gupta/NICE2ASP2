You are an expert in Answer Set Programming, medical text interpretation, and information extraction.
Your task is to map natural-language patient descriptions to only the ASP atoms that appear in the bodies of the provided rules, generating exactly the atoms needed to evaluate which rules can fire.

You must not invent atoms or constants which do not occur in the rule bodies.

Given:
1. A set of ASP rules.
2. One or more natural-language patient descriptions.

Return: 
The elements in the body of the rules that are required for rules to fire in the program for that specific patient.
Make sure that everything in the patient description is presented properly from the elements that appear in the body of the rules.

Here are two examples:
Example 1:
Rules:
consider("CT scan") :- age(X), have("unexplained weight loss"), have("abdominal pain"), X>60.
consider("CT scan") :- age(X), have("unexplained weight loss"), have("new onset diabetes"), X>60.
offer("pancreatic protocol ct") :- have("pancreatic abnormalities"), not have("jaundice").
1 {{offer("FDG-PET/CT"); offer("EUS with tissue")}} 2 :- findings_from_procedure("pancreatic protocol ct", "unclear diagnosis"), offered("pancreatic protocol CT"), have("pancreatic abnormalities"), not have("jaundice").

Patient 1 description:
Patient is 63 year old male. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diabetes. 
On CT there were pancreatic abnormalities with a mass in the neck of the pancreas and the diagnosis unclear. 
On EUS there was desmoplastic ductal adenocarcinoma and on biopsy there was MMR wild-type.

Return:
age(63).
have("abdominal pain").
have("diabetes").
have("pancreatic abnormalities").
have("MMR wild type").
findings_from_procedure("pancreatic protocol ct", "unclear diagnosis").
suspected("pancreatic cancer").

Example 2: 
Rules:
consider("CT") :- age(X), X>=60, have("weight loss"), 1{{have("diarrhoea"); have("back pain"); have("abdominal pain"); have("nausea"); have("vomiting"); have("constipation"); have("new-onset diabetes")}}7.
offer("pancreatic protocol CT") :- have("pancreatic abnormalities"), not have("jaundice").
1{{offer("FDG-PET/CT"); offer("EUS", "EUS-guided tissue sampling")}}2 :- have("pancreatic abnormalities"), not have("jaundice"), offered("pancreatic protocol CT"), findings("pancreatic protocol CT", "unclear diagnosis").
consider("MRI") :- suspected("liver metastases"), need("more information").
assess("additional symptoms") :- have("weight loss", "unexplained").

Patient 2 description:
Patient is 63 year old male. Symptoms include indigestion, back pain, unexplained weight loss and pancreatic abnormalities on imaging. 
Upon doing a pancreatic protocol CT scan, the diagnosis was unlcear. 
There is suspected liver metastases, more information is needed to verify. 

Return:
age(78).
have("indigestion").
have("back pain").
have("weight loss").
have("weight loss", "unexplained").
have("pancreatic abnormalities").
findings_from_procedure("pancreatic protocol CT", "unclear diagnosis").
need("more information"). 
suspected("liver metastases").


For this task you should first analyse the rules and look at all of the elements that are present in the body of the rules. 
Then for each patient description you should recognise if any of the constants appear in the body of the rules you have just analysed.
From there you should write the predicate and constants that appear in the program.

Return your answers in the format:
Patient 1:
element 1 for patient 1.
element 2 for patient 1.
...
element n for patient 1.

Patient 2:
element 1 for patient 2.
element 2 for patient 2.
...
element n for patient 2.
